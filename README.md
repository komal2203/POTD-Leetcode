# 📅 LeetCode POTD Tracker

Welcome to my **LeetCode Problem of the Day (POTD)** repository!  
This repo serves as a personal log of the daily problems I solve on LeetCode. It helps me track my consistency, review past problems easily, and reflect on progress over time. 🚀

---

## 📌 Purpose

- 🧠 **Track Daily Practice** — Stay consistent with daily problem-solving.
- 📚 **Review Later** — Quickly revisit solved problems when needed.
- ⭐ **Difficulty Marking** — Each commit includes difficulty:
  - `⭐` Easy  
  - `⭐⭐` Medium  
  - `⭐⭐⭐` Hard

---

## 📂 How It's Organized

- Each day, I commit the **LeetCode POTD link** (not full code).
- The commit message shows the date and difficulty using stars.
- This repo keeps things **lightweight** and **easy to browse**.


---

## 🔗 Why Just Links?

This repo is purely for **tracking** and **accountability** — no full solutions are uploaded here to respect LeetCode's content guidelines and keep the repo clean.

If you'd like to see full solutions or explanations, check out my other repos or notes (if any)!
